# CppUtilities

A collection of various tools, side projects, and challenges I've written (and am writing) for learning purposes. Many of the projects, 
while functional, aren't in finished states and could use a lot of cleaning up. Some are alsp in non-functional states as well.

This is NOT intended to be professional-level code, and the modules within this repo are primarily useful as proof-of-concepts and code snippets. Additionally, after beginning some of the modules I discovered that some of those exact same ideas were already present in Boost, with full functionality and more polish.
