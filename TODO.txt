1) Finish matrix(s) implementations

2) Write tuple extension module

3) Implement alternate methods of training neural nets

4) Write test to compare k-dimension tree performance and accuracy with neural net results

5) Clean up commented out/unused code

6) Update/Clean up Func module
    6.1) Pseudo-Bind() functionality
    6.2) Tuple as args functionality

9) nth Polynomial Estimation module?

10) Look into algorithms for nonlinear regression

11) Implement matrix equation solver method(s)
    11.1) Useful for nth polynomial calculation

13) Rewrite matrix module to:
    13.1) Rename matrix_t to tensor_t
    13.2) Change tensor_t to inherit from std::shared_ptr<Matrix<...>>
    13.3) Use tensor_t as internal ptr representation
    13.4) Integrate tensor_t<Dims,...> and tensor_t<1,...> into one class
