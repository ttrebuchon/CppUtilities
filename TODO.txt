1) Finish matrix(s) implementations

2) Write tuple extension module

3) Implement alternate methods of training neural nets

4) Write test to compare k-dimension tree performance and accuracy with neural net results

5) Clean up commented out/unused code

6) Update/Clean up Func module
    6.1) Pseudo-Bind() functionality
    6.2) Tuple as args functionality

8) Fix likely memory leaks in operations in matrix module (Read: Fix careless implementation)

9) nth Polynomial Estimation module?

10) Look into algorithms for nonlinear regression

11) Implement matrix equation solver method(s)
    11.1) Useful for nth polynomial calculation

12) Add operator()(Index...) methods to matrix classes that return references to values for applicable classes (So that values may be modified if possible)
